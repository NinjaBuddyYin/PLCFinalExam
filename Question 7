Tombstone are costly in both time and space as they are never deallocated and their storage is never reclaimed. . Every access to a heap dynamic variable requires one more level of indirection which will require extra additional machine cycle on most systems.

In lock and key method pointer value at represented as orders pairs and heap dynamic are represented as the storage for variable and also a header cell that will store the integer lock value. When a heap dynamic variable is allocated, a lock value is created and placed in the lock cell of heap dynamic and key cell of the pointer . And every access to pointer compares the key value to the lock value in heap dynamic and if they match the access is legal otherwise it is run time error.
