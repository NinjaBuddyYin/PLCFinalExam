Both solutions having complexity O(1) because both solutions are free from loops. But speed wise solution1 is much better than solution2 because in solution2, each time it executes it will check each condition because we have not used any else statements. But in solution1 , there will be chances where code can skip multiple conditions which makes this code more reliable and faster.
