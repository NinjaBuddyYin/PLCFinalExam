The form "while B do S end" can be written as:

{ P } while B do S end { Q }

where P is the Precondition and Q the postcondition

The four criteria to prove while loop construct correct are:

P => I

{I and B} S {I}

(I and (not B)) => Q

the loop terminates

Criteria 1: P => I : The loop invariant must be true initially

Criteria 2: {I and B} S {I} : The loop invariant is not changed by executing the body of loop

Criteria 3: (I and (not B)) => Q : If I is true and B is false then Q is true

Criteria 4: the loop terminates

Proving Correctness of given while loop:

Criteria 1: The invariant that can be used here is that Power>0 . This holds true initially.

Criteria 2: After loop is executed value of power is still more than 0.

Criteria 3: When i>n i.e. B gets false but I is true, the Q is true. After the loop power = x^n which is same as Q

Criteria 4: After B gets false loop terminates
